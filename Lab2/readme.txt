This is the first Lab Assignment that I (Daniel Ginovker) have completed completely independently.
This program uses function and struct pointers to dynamically create a store and accessors and mutators to change and print the elements of the store.


Question 1: Argument for the function pointer inside Store
Answer: The argument should be a void container so it can typecast it into anything it needs to print

Question 2: Change the Store to contain a pointer to Book instead. What happens?
Since it's a pointer and it's being typecasted it doesn't matter if it's a pointer to a Book or a Store. It works the same.
With that said, I was blown away and thought it was the coolest thing in the world at the time.
