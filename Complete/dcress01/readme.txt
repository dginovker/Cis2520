Compilation
************
Type "make" to compile the main program. "main.out" is generated and inserted into the /bin directory.
Type "make test" to compile the testing program. "testMain.out" is generated and inserted into the /bin directory.

***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
 To run the main program, run main.out in the /bin directory.
 The first command line argument should be the file that has the dictionary words in it.

 If you add a word that's already in the dictionary, while it will let you add the word it won't cause any problems
while running the spellchecker. This is because duplication check is inside the spellchecker, rather than File IO and
user input.
  The order that the incorrectly spelled words is printed out is slightly different than that of the exampleOutput, but
this isn't a game-changing error by any means.

Additional notes:
  The program can read both UNIX and Windows based files (it handles the carrige return generated by Windows machines)
  Invalid entry at the option menu will cause program to quit (safely)
  There is user input checking, but it's not perfect (you can enter characters/spaces in most places)

 To run the test program, run testMain.out in the /bin directory. There are no additional parameters.

Collision resolution strategy:
  When adding a word to the hashmap, it adds a Node that has the key, the word, and a node to the next and previous
node in the hashmap for the same key (a barebones linked list). When entering the first entry to the hashmap of that
key, the next and previous are set to NULL. If another word is added via the same key, its node has it's next set to
NULL and previous set to the first node in the list; and then the first node in the list has its next set to the node
just added.
