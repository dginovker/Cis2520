Compilation
************
  Type "make" to create the program. Compiled executable named "main.out" will be
placed in /bin directory.

  Type "make test" to create the test program. Compiled executable named "testMain.out"
will be placed in /bin directory.


***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
Run normally. No command line arguments for main.out or testMain.out.
Integers should be passed in one at a time.

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
  Entering multiple integers on the same line seperated by spaces makes the output look
weird. The program doesn't break, but the output newlines aren't aligned and it's an
unclean look.
